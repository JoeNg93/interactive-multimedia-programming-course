          What you can do with jQuery? <b>Answer</b>: jQuery is a JavaScript library that can be used for DOM
          Manipulation and Network Requests
        </li>
        <li>
          How it can help you as web developer? <b>Answer</b>: Since it's just a JavaScript library, it does not take
          much time to learn. The reason for learning it is that it offers a trivial and easy way to manipulate DOM and
          make network requests.

          If you think our earlier participant list app, in which kind of issues you could use jQuery? <b>Answer</b>:
          jQuery can be used whenever we want to manipulate the DOM (Add new person to list, create event handlers,
          etc). Later if we want to persist the data in some kind of database, jQuery can help to create network
          requests much easier than vanilla JavaScript.

          What are CDNs? What kind of benefits you get if you use them? <b>Answer</b>: CDN, which stands for Content
          Delivery Network, is a set of servers that can be used to delivery web assets (pages, css and js files,
          images, etc) to users in the fastest way. No matter where users are, content will be delivered from nearest
          servers to users. As a result, users can load the web pages as fast as possible.
