    <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>HTML</b>:
        HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language", which is a kind of language used by Web Browser
        to describe web pages using normal text. It contains a set of syntax that can be understand & parse by
        Web Browser to proper format pages
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CSS</b>:
        CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet", which is a kind language which can be parsed by Web Browser
        to define how the pages should be layout, displayed and formatted on digital screens.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>JavaScript</b>:
        JavaScript is a programming language. It's mostly used in Web Browser and is the most popular programming
        language
        for Web Development. It can be used together with HTML, CSS to build web pages and the role of JS is to
        define behaviors of web pages. Nowadays, JavaScript is used everywhere, from UI to Server Side, Desktop App and
        even
        Embedded System
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>HTTP</b>:
        HTTP stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol", which is a protocol built on top of TCP protocol. It defines a
        set
        of
        standards which can be agreed by clients and servers in order to communicate to each other. It's mostly used for
        WWW (the Internet) system where Web Browsers act as clients and other computers act as servers. Every request
        made
        to servers must follow HTTP Protocol and also the responses from servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>HTML5</b>:
        HTML5 is the newest version of HTML. It extends HTML functionality by adding some features such as
        geolocation, video and graphics, etc. Those are things that are came as plugins in the past for HTML.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dynamic HTML</b>:
        Dynamic HTML is a term which combines HTML + CSS + JS altogether to make a web page more interactive without the
        need of
        server side. Therefore, it can improve user experience. One example could be that when you hover your mouse
        to a button, the button becomes a little bit bigger and the background color of a button change slowly from
        original
        color to another
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
    <p>
      Code conventions can be used to make sure that the code written is consistent, it should be feel like the
      code is writen by one person even there is a whole team behind it. By making sure everyone follow the convention
      and have the same mindset, they can easily understand the structure of the code writen by other members in the
      team.
      Personally, I feel that code convention is a thing that a programmer need to learn before making his first
      step to the IT industry. I'm going to follow <a href="http://codeguide.co">this guide</a> convention for HTML and
      CSS
